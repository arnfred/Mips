Mips
====

A simple and incomplete Mips simulator written in Haskell.

It can execute a 'mips program' implemented as a domain specific language in
haskell and show the state of memory for each step in the program. I wrote the
program to get a better understand of mips processors in 2009, but I'm a little
doubtful that it has any practical use.
